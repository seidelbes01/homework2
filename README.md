# homework2
For this homework, I would like you to choose a speech given by a former United States president and perform a textual analysis. 
You may select certain words (at least 10 words) and analyze their frequency and placement within the speech. 
For instance, you could determine whether the chosen words were used at the beginning or end of the speech, 
or whether their frequency increased or decreased over the course of the speech. 
Alternatively, you may come up with other interesting questions to explore using Python's string and substring functions.
