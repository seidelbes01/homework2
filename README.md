For this homework, I have chosen a speech given by a former United States president and performed a textual analysis. 
I selected certain words and analyzed their frequency and placement within the speech. 

For instance, you could determine whether the chosen words were used at the beginning or end of the speech, 
or whether their frequency increased or decreased over the course of the speech. 
Alternatively, you may come up with other interesting questions to explore using Python's string and substring functions.
